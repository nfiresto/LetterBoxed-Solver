Ok so this was a project I made to solve the letter boxed game on the New York Times Games site. 

I did a lot of this over two years ago and I don't really remember the motivation behind some of the files in this repository. 

The key file of importance is 'LetterBoxedSolver.py'. Upon running the file you can input the letters in the game into the terminal and then it will output the best pair of words to solve the puzzle.
